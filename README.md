# Machine Learning Classifiers

## Setup

To run the program, it's recommended to use a virtual environment. Here's how to set it up:

### Using Conda

```bash
conda create --name myenv
conda activate myenv
```

### Using Virtualenv

```bash
virtualenv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate
```

The project is written in Python 3.12.3.

To install the required packages, make sure you have pip installed and run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To get started, choose a dataset and a classifier that you want to experiment with. You can select datasets from the [toy datasets](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/toy_dataset.html#toy-datasets) provided by scikit-learn.

These visualizations provide insights into the performance of the selected classifier and the structure of the dataset after dimensionality reduction.
